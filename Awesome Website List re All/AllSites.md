  # All Useful Websites
These range from locating torrent or [mostly] DDL websites re Movies, TV and Documentaries. At the bottom, there will also be a subsection for all porn related inquiries.   

I personally do not find the whole "Furry" thing appealing, so any sites where that is the main focus are not included in this list. Sorry, I had a hard enough time compiling my favorites and curating this list. Otherwise, all general varieties should be available within any of the websites located in this list (TS, Gay, Straight, Bi, etc). 

Finally, there is also an admittedly small subsection which highlight websites that are great for finding amateur content, in particular. 

As always, any comments/concerns/suggestions are welcome and encouraged. 

##### Sidenote
When using Mega.nz links stemming from forum.snahp.it and you come across the following (instead of the usual base64 decoder):

MEGA | Combine M + K
-----------|-------------
M: #F!ZCoGHZAb
K: !KWCq6BKTN33UXUd_NOzoLQ

All you need to do is type mega.nz/MK and replace the "M" and "K" with the characters given by the OP poser. Thus, instead it will look like  mega.nz/#F!ZCoGHZAb!KWCq6BKTN33UXUd_NOzoLQ
