# Master List of Crucial Software & Resources

## Overview
The following is a list of programs, websites and software that I find to be extremely useful and, as a result, I end up installing over every new machine I acquire. The items are broken down into groups based on their primary function, for the sake of clarity and organization, since several sites/software obviously serve multiple purposes. 

Most, if not all, of the item located in this list are **FREE**. So, when suggesting new items or criticizing already listed items for their inefficacy (rather than an actual issue/problem), please keep that in mind.

Any and all suggestions for new items are welcomed and encouraged. Furthermore, if you notice there is an issue with any of the items in the list, also please let me know and open up an issue regarding it. Please only do this if there is an actual problem with the software or site (e.g. no longer maintained; contains malware; etc), and not solely because you happen to dislike the item from your own personal standpoint.

Finally, and most importantly, I made this list solely for fun and personal reference. I know how overwhelming it can be when you are trying to find new ways to learn or improve your machine, and you don't even know where to begin. This is my collection of stuff I have found over the years.

SideNote: Some things that are ridiculously obvious and/or very commercial have been omitted. An easy example of this would be Microsoft Office. We all know what Office is and what it does, so why waste space by adding it here, know what I mean?

That is my Spiel. Now, on with the list!
